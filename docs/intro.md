# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide is designed to introduce you to the fascinating world of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

Physical AI is an interdisciplinary field that combines robotics, machine learning, control theory, and mechanical engineering to create intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Humanoid robotics specifically focuses on robots with human-like characteristics and capabilities.

In this textbook, we'll explore:

- The fundamentals of physical AI and its applications
- Design principles for humanoid robots
- Control systems for dynamic movement
- Sensory perception and environmental interaction
- Machine learning approaches for embodied intelligence
- Ethical considerations in humanoid robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the core principles of physical AI
- Analyze the design considerations for humanoid robots
- Implement basic control algorithms for robotic systems
- Evaluate the ethical implications of humanoid robotics
- Design simple robotic behaviors using machine learning

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this course, you should have:

- Basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra
- Fundamentals of programming (preferably Python)
- Introductory knowledge of physics (mechanics)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four main modules, each building upon the previous one. Each module includes theoretical foundations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

Throughout the course, you'll encounter:

- Key concept explanations with diagrams
