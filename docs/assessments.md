# Assessments

This section contains assessments and exercises that align with the course content on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. These assessments are designed to reinforce learning outcomes and provide opportunities for self-evaluation.

## Assessment Overview

The course includes multiple assessment types:

- **Knowledge Checks**: Short quizzes to verify understanding of key concepts
- **Problem Sets**: Mathematical and programming exercises to apply course concepts
- **Project Assignments**: Longer-term projects to develop practical skills
- **Peer Evaluations**: Collaborative assessments to learn from fellow students
- **Self-Assessments**: Reflection activities to evaluate personal progress

## Module 1 Assessments

**Instructions**: Answer the following questions to test your understanding of Module 1 content.

1. Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches.
2. Explain the challenges of creating embodied intelligence.

### Problem Set 1: Physical AI Concepts

**Question 1**: Describe the "reality gap" in Physical AI and propose strategies to address it.

**Question 2**: Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of different perception systems (visual, tactile, auditory) for a humanoid robot operating in a home environment.

**Question 3**: Consider a task where a robot must navigate an unknown environment to find a specific object. Design the perception-action loop for this task, identifying the key components and potential challenges.

## Module 2 Assessments

**Question 2**: You are tasked with selecting actuation systems for a humanoid robot. Compare servo motors, series elastic actuators, and pneumatic systems for a robot that will be interacting with humans. Provide pros and cons for each option.

**Question 3**: Explain the differences between static and dynamic balance in humanoid robots. For each approach, describe scenarios where it would be most appropriate.

## Module 3 Assessments

### Knowledge Check: Control Systems for Dynamic Movement

**Instructions**: Answer the following questions to test your understanding of Module 3.

2. Design basic controllers for robotic joints and systems.
3. Analyze stability and performance of control systems.
4. Implement control strategies for balance and locomotion.

### Problem Set 3: Control System Design

**Question 1**: For a single joint robot arm, design a PID controller to follow a trajectory. Assume you have access to position, velocity, and acceleration sensors. Explain how you would tune the PID parameters.

**Question 2**: Explain the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) concept and how it is used in humanoid balance control. What are the limitations of ZMP-based control?

**Question 3**: Compare computed torque control and operational space control for a manipulator task. Discuss when each approach would be preferred.

## Module 4 Assessments

1. Apply reinforcement learning techniques to robotic control.
2. Implement imitation learning for skill transfer.
3. Evaluate the challenges of learning in physical systems.
4. Design safe exploration strategies for physical robots.

### Problem Set 4: Learning in Physical Systems

**Question 1**: Compare model-free and model-based reinforcement learning approaches for robotic manipulation. Discuss the trade-offs in terms of sample efficiency, computational requirements, and safety.

**Question 2**: Design an imitation learning system for teaching a robot a simple manipulation task (e.g., picking up a cup). What demonstrations would you collect, and what learning approach would you use?
