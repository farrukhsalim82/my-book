# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive resource covers fundamental concepts, design principles, control systems, and machine learning applications in embodied intelligence.

## Overview

This textbook serves as the primary resource for a comprehensive course on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It covers:

- Fundamentals of Physical AI
- Design principles for humanoid robots
- Control systems for dynamic movement
- Machine learning for embodied intelligence
- Practical applications and implementation

## Table of Contents

The textbook is organized into several key sections:

1. [Introduction](./docs/intro.md) - Overview and course objectives
2. [Module 1: Fundamentals of Physical AI](./docs/module-1.md) - Core concepts and components
3. [Module 2: Design Principles for Humanoid Robots](./docs/module-2.md) - Architecture and design considerations
4. [Module 3: Control Systems for Dynamic Movement](./docs/module-3.md) - Control theory and implementation
5. [Module 4: Machine Learning for Embodied Intelligence](./docs/module-4.md) - Learning in physical systems
6. [Weekly Breakdown](./docs/weekly-breakdown.md) - 16-week course timeline
7. [Assessments](./docs/assessments.md) - Quizzes, assignments, and projects
8. [Hardware Requirements](./docs/hardware-requirements.md) - Equipment and computational needs

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this course, students should have:

- Basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra
- Fundamentals of programming (preferably Python)
- Introductory knowledge of physics (mechanics)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-book.git
   cd my-book
   ```
